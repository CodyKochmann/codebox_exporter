Description: Python based snippet extractor for CodeBox.app on the Mac.

Usage: 
- Copy the codebox database to the main directory of this app.
- Run "Python main.py"
- Take the ".json" file or the ".csv" file and put it wherever.

Notes:
- this exports a json and csv database designed as {snipppet_db:[{name:,modified:,notes:,content:},]}
- this was designed for the database for version 1.6 so comparability may be buggy.

To Do List:
- [ ] add version control
- [ ] add future version support
- [ ] add tag retrieval
